        <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>After completing my baccalaureate, I was admitted to a BUT 
          (Bachelor's Degree) in Digital Information within Organizations. 
          This program allows me to enhance my writing and speaking skills 
          for information projects. It also promotes learning communication 
          strategies for quick and effective dissemination, all with proficiency 
          in most of the necessary computer tools.</p>

            <p>I completed my 2023 internship at BMW and BMW Motorrad in La Rochelle, 
              and my 2024 internship at The Lifestyle Company, a distributor of major 
              international ready-to-wear brands. During these busy work periods, I 
              demonstrated curiosity, motivation, and rigor. I applied everything I 
              had learned during my first two years of higher education to successfully 
              carry out written communication, marketing, and event planning operations.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, I have significant musical knowledge that should not be overlooked. 
              From 6th to 9th grade, I was in a Music-Focused Schedule Class, which allowed me to 
              develop my knowledge in more classical areas, such as music theory and my ability 
              to play in groups. Consequently, I have now been pursuing my musical practice for 
              12 years, particularly with guitar, piano, digital audio workstations, writing, 
              singing, mixing, and promoting my works. Today, I have accumulated over 13 million 
              streams/uses of my music across all platforms. (My most accomplished songs are 
              "Davis Miles" and "STORY.")</p>
            
            <p><b>After completing my degree, I plan to continue my studies by pursuing a master's degree 
              in the field of INFOCOM or Journalism. Please find attached my Curriculum Vitae for your review.</b></p>
